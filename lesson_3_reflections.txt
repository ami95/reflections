When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    
    I would rather always be using a remote repository, since it can store my 
    project, and even keep it private(if for some reason I wanted to).
    I would also use it when I wanted people to see my work and benefit from
    their feedback and contributions.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
