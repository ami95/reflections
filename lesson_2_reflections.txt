What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository, a hidden folder (.git) is created.
	There, the entire history of my project will be saved.
	I need to run the "git init" command whenever I create a new 
	project and I want to use github on it. (This is not necessary
	to do when I clone a project, as it already has a .git folder)
