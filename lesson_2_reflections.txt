What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository, a hidden folder (.git) is created.
	There, the entire history of my project will be saved.
	I need to run the "git init" command whenever I create a new 
	project and I want to use github on it. (This is not necessary
	to do when I clone a project, as it already has a .git folder)


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different from the working directory in it's nature of "purgatory like place", when 
	the working directory is the hell and damnation where from the suffering and screaming of the damned 
	a piece of heaven is created, we first test these potential pieces of heaven just like Jesus said 
	about testing something through fire. This is why we need a staging area, so we won't mix any bad 
	things from hell into heaven. 
	It(the staging area) is also useful because it allows as to choose which/how many files we will update 
	in a single "commit".
